# TechPlex

A mod for Minecraft 1.8, that adds complex technical to the game. 
Inspired by the current popular technology mods, such as IndustrialCraft 2, Thermal Expansion and MineFactory Reloaded.

(Will update the mod to the next stable forge version, as soon as possible)

DONE:
  + New ores (Tin, Copper, Bauxite, Silver(?), Lead and Titanium)
  + New tree (Sharinga (For resin))
  + World Generation for the ores and tree
  + Cables (Atm. Tin and Copper grade)
  + Most of the items needed for crafting in this mod

TODO:

Power system (Energy system to power the machines, produced by different generators)

  -> Different power levels (Atm. using RF, maybe going independent on later update)
  
Machines:

  -> Generators, can't have machines without energy.

  -> Ore processing (Either by Crushing/Macerating/Pulverize, and smelting using power)
  
  -> Farmer Machines, to chop tree, harvest crops and possible mobs?
  
  -> Advanced smelter to mix ores and more (AKA AlloyFurnce)
  
  -> Multiblock machines (Later update)
  
  -> Upgrades for machines (Later update).

Gear:

  -> Wrench, for managing the machines
  
  -> Hard to craft jetpack(?)

WorldGen:

  -> Forgotten technology lab dungeon (W. important TechPlex materials, and low chance of containing finished machines) 

List will keep growing.
